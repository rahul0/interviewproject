Interview project

My assumptions:
This is a single user Battleship game.
I'm doing the following things
a)First create a board,a sking user for ship count and ship size, directions etc.
b)After this user enter possible position(x,y) where ship may be.
c)Prints all the possible outcomes based on the problem description like Hit, Miss, Already taken, Win, Sunk.
d)I have added standard validation of input.


To run the game.
a)Please checkout project and run Battleship.main()
